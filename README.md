# Stock-Price-Prediction

# Project Overview
The goal is to predict the future closing prices of a stock using its historical closing prices. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series data, capturing long-term dependencies for better forecasting.

# Working
1. Data Acquisition:
Download historical stock prices for any ticker using `yfinance` (defaults to Microsoft/MSFT, 2017-2025).
Run:
  python get_data.py
2. Data Preprocessing:
Only the “Close” price is used. Data is saved as `stock_data.csv` for modeling.
3. Sequence Preparation & Scaling:
Past price windows (lookback=45 days) are used to predict the next day’s price, scaled for neural network learning.
4. Model Training:
An LSTM deep learning model is trained to learn sequence patterns. Early stopping prevents overfitting.
5. Evaluation & Visualisation:
Model predictions are compared with actual prices on unseen data. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is displayed.
A plot is generated: `plot_alt_lstm.png`.

# How To Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run data download and preparation:
   python get_data.py
This creates `stock_data.csv`.
3. Train and evaluate the model:
   python model_lstm.py
This will:
	•	Train the LSTM model
	•	Save the model as `lstm_model.keras`
	•	Output Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predictions
	•	Generate and save `plot_alt_lstm.png`

# File Reference
	•	`get_data.py`: Downloads and saves stock data as CSV.
	•	`model_lstm.py`: Builds model, trains, evaluates, and plots results.
	•	`stock_data.csv`: Downloaded/prepared data.
	•	`plot_alt_lstm.png`: Saved figure of predicted vs actual prices.
	•	`requirements.txt`: Dependency list for clean installs.

# Date range: Adjust `START` and `END` in `get_data.py` as needed.
# Ticker: Change the `TICKER` variable in `get_data.py` to any valid Yahoo Finance symbol, such as `'AAPL'`, `'GOOG'`, etc.
